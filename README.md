# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price prediction using a hybrid MS-SSA-LSTM model integrating sentiment analysis
# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LSTM & Sentiment Analysis

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks combined with sentiment analysis to predict stock prices. The model is optimized using the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) to enhance accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Model Development**: Integrated LSTM with sentiment analysis for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Version Control**: Utilized Git and GitHub for efficient code management and collaboration.
- **Automation**: Implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Containerization**: Employed Docker to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed the application on cloud infrastructure for scalable access.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Docker, Git, GitHub, CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (e.g., EC2, Lambda)
